# Booking Hub - Family Friendly Room in Leuven

This is a simple "booking hub" page used by the visiting card QR code.

## How to host on GitHub Pages (recommended)

1. Create a new GitHub repository (public) named:
   `leuven-family-room`

2. Upload `index.html` to the root of the repo.

3. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Repo **Settings** -> **Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / **root**
   - Save

4. Your URL will look like:
   `https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/leuven-family-room/`

## Important

After your GitHub Pages URL is live, re-generate the QR code and update the card (optional).
Right now, the supplied card includes a placeholder URL:
`https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/leuven-family-room/`
